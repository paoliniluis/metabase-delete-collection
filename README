# Delete collections in Metabase

You can't delete collections in Metabase, but this script will do its best to make that happen

## Reason why you can't do this yet

There are a lot of child dependencies in Metabase that doesn't allow a clean wipe of the collections entity in Metabase, e.g. permissions.

## What do you need to run this script:

- Node.js LTS
- the credentials of the Metabase app DB

## How to run this

Simply run
`DB_USER=<your_app_db_user> DB_PASSWORD=<your_app_db_password> DB_HOST=<the_hostname_of_your_app_db> DB_PORT=<the_app_db_port> DB_DATABASE=<the_database_where_metabase_app_db_is_located> COLLECTION_ID=<the_collection_you_want_to_delete> node index.js`

This script will generate a finalSQL.sql file in the directory where you're running the script that will delete the collections and its siblings along all entities that exist on these (e.g. questions, dashboards, etc)
